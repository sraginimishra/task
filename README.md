### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

Here I have attached some files to get staerted with the project for Task Manager Using HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Create a Database, Here I am using Xampp database called phpmyadmin.
Then save the files with name given and same extensions.
Run into your local server to see the demo.



Here I was told to Generate a Task Bar where a user can add a task by clicking an + Button and then by the single click a timer should be started and by the second time single click it should be stopped.
I have added a input box to add a task by clicking + button.
Here I knew how to run a stopwatch but I dont understand how to add here for new tasks.
So I have just bgiven two buttons to start and stop the watch and also commented the rest of stopwatch part.

If you can help.Your sugggetsions are always welcome!
Thankyou
